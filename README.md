This is a simple 2D physics engine project i work on in my spare time. It is in a very early stage. Any pull request or issue is welcome.

I haven't integrated any build systems so it is just a bunch of source files. If you want to get it and build it in this stage, i don't have a way to help you right now you have to set it up yourself.
